echo "3. Verify that:"
echo "   - Dark theme is applied"
echo "   - File loads successfully"
echo "   - Disassembly shows actual x86/x86-64 instructions (not just NOPs)"
echo "   - Functions tree shows 'main' function"
echo "   - Sections table shows .text section"
echo "   - Architecture is detected correctly"
echo "4. Try Debug -> Start Debugging to test debug functionality"
echo "5. Try Tools -> Analyze Functions"

echo "Known working features:"
echo "✓ Dark theme GUI"
echo "✓ ELF file loading and parsing"
echo "✓ Real disassembly (fixed from dummy NOPs)"
echo "✓ Multi-architecture support"
echo "✓ Basic debugging foundation"
echo "✓ File analysis panels"

echo "- Memory inspection"
echo "- Register viewing"
echo "- Advanced decompilation"
